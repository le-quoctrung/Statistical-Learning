# Statistical-Learning
This repo include 2 project about Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. 

- Both are self-implement from scratch:
	- Normalize, standarlize dataset
	- Calculate gradient, do gradient decent 
	- Compute cost from cost function 
	- Evaluate the model
	- Predict value
	
	
- Workflow: 
	- read config.json file for model's hyperparameter
	- read and handle, preprocess data
	- training model
	- visualize trained model
	- save model's parameter after training for future work
	
	
- file structure:
	- config.json: hyperparameter for init
	- model.json: model's parameter after training
	- .ipynb file: main project
	- map_feature.py: create/map for feature from original data
